# Jiannina Pinto's Bloomdata Python Package

Inside of the <code>bloomdatajp</code> package you will find a module called <code>helper_functions_jp.py</code> that you can import into your own file to help you clean your code while making it easier to read and follow.

You can also run tests by using the file <code>test_helper_functions_jp</code> if you want to make sure the helper functions are working as intended.
